It's a Sunday and well, for someone who is in his mid-20s, it's a completely free Sunday with a sneezing nose due to "influenza", and I don't even know what it's like to have the flu and how to take care of myself while having it, after tons of times having it in the past. And suddenly... I have no idea what to do next.

If it were some of the senpais or acquaintances of mine, probably these days they would visit family, friends, learn some serious stuff, or maybe just purely chill with whatever. The funny thing is, not a single thing above is something I can do or enjoy doing. Or maybe it's time to replan things for the next month (since it's the last day of the current month), next quarter, or next life chapter? Actually, things always get so messy that I don't even know where to start. And it is how it is. Actually, I had some small conversations with people a bit like me, who has the same sort of questions like "I'm having a struggle, what do I do next?" Sometimes people look into courses, advice, tutorials, etc. I did the same thing, and I realized that probably it's not the best way. You can grasp some of the maybe fundamental ideas, like, don't do too stupid stuff. But after that, what's the best way to do something, how should I think about an event, how should I even feel about something with metacognition, etc. To me, probably there is no answer. We can only keep going, step by step. Maybe if you have a question like, "Should I learn pointers in C? Since I don't care about low-level programming languages?" or "How do I get out of tutorial hell? I can't code anything out of that." (I was asked those questions fr). I'm not a development guru, not to mention that I'm a super newbie knowing nothing, but yeah, that's all you can do. 

I miss the days I used to be like, read a post from Microsoft AI and start to imagine building an AI companion on my own lol. Then start to break down steps and feel overwhelmed by the topics I'll need to learn. Then I realized, probably just take a very small step, like, okay, buy a very cheap server, start trying a vector database **just for fun out of it**, and that's all. Then maybe today is the day to do it. And on another Sunday, or in another evening after work hours. Yeah, probably let's do that. Let things unfold naturally and just be you and do whatever feels fine.

(Sorry if I didn't take into account a lot of people with hardship in life. I know I'm kinda lucky to have just the luxury of time to think on this free Sunday, and I haven't done much to contribute to the society, but yeah, honestly I can't do much, so forgive me for that.).
