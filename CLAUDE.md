# Blog Guide

Don't add `# Title` heading in post content - Jekyll renders title from frontmatter automatically.

## Commands

`docker compose up` - Local dev server (http://127.0.0.1:4000/) with live reload
`docker compose down` - Stop the server

## Writing Style

- Conversational, thinking-out-loud tone. Not polished or formal.
- Short sentences. Fragment sentences are fine.
- No em dashes (`—`). Use periods or commas instead.
- Honest about not understanding things. "I didn't fully understand" is better than pretending.
- Casual transitions: "Nice.", "Long wait.", "Almost forgot."
- No summary/conclusion sections that repeat what was already said.
- Code examples when relevant, but don't overload.
- Posts come from real experience building things, not tutorials.

## Post Conventions

- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- Frontmatter: layout, title, date, categories, tags
- Categories: `[tech]`
- No `# Title` in body (rendered from frontmatter)
